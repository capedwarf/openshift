Running CapeDwarf on OpenShift
=============

Follow this instructions to run GAE applications on OpenShift PaaS.

Prepare environment
-------
1. [Register](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new) for OpenShift
2. Follow the [instructions](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/getting_started) to install *client tools* (step one)
3. Create a domain (step two on the link above)
4. Create JBoss AS applications
	
	rhc app create -t jbossas-7 -a mygaeapp
	
5. Use [this repo](https://github.com/capedwarf/openshift) files to add CapeDwarf and dependent modules to JBoss AS.
Avoiding conflicts specify git options to prefer Capedwarf repo content.
	
	cd mygaeapp
	git remote add capedwarf-openshift https://github.com/capedwarf/openshift.git
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs capedwarf-openshift master

6. Copy your GAE application to mygaeapp/deployments folder.
	If you want to build your project using maven on OpenShift copy sources to src folder and remove marker skip_maven_build from <app dir>/.openshift/markers/ folder.

7. Push CapeDwarf modules and your app to OpenShift using:
	
	git push origin
	
If you are redeploying your app, replace archive file in deployments dir (or src if building on OpenShift) and commit/push changes to OpenShift

	git commit -a -m"Added new feature xyz"
	git push origin
